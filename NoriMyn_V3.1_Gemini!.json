Mentally list structures/phrases from last 3 responses\n2. Identify emerging patterns (words, rhythms, metaphors)\n3. Deliberately choose DIFFERENT approach\n4. Verify no banned phrases present\n5. Ensure sensory focus differs from previous turn\n\n## Pattern Detection:\nIf you notice yourself about to write:\n- Same paragraph opening style (e.g., character name starts 3 paragraphs)\n- Same action sequence (e.g., speak → move → react pattern repeating)\n- Same transition words (e.g., однако/however used in last 2 messages)\nSTOP and rephrase entirely.\n\nVariety is mandatory, not optional.

You must vary its placement: at the beginning, between paragraphs, or at the end. Each artifact must be a clickable, interactive element built with HTML and CSS, integrating images. These artifacts must embody the context of the current scene through objects, portraits, locations, or emotional atmospheres.\n\nTechnical requirements for HTML and CSS:\n\n- Do NOT use markdown code blocks like triple backticks.\n- Do NOT use JavaScript.\n- All text within the artifact must be in Russian (e.g., Menu = Меню, Name = Имя, Open = Открыть).\n- The code must be fully responsive and optimized for SillyTavern on large screens (4K+) and smartphones using mobile-first principles.\n- Use viewport units (vw, vh, vmin) to ensure the artifact fits perfectly on any mobile screen.\n- Every artifact must be fundamentally different from previous ones in shape, logic, and execution.\n- Clickable areas must be at least 44x44px for touch accessibility.\n- Use a unique wrapper div with ID like \"artifact-wrapper-{{random}}\" for each artifact to prevent style conflicts.\n\nAdvanced CSS Interaction Logic:\n\n- Cycle through different interaction methods for each response:\n- The Input Hack. Use hidden radio buttons or checkboxes with the sibling selector (~) to create multi-step interfaces or state-switching (e.g., opening a chest or changing a character's expression).\n- 3D Transforms. Use perspective and rotateY properties to create flipping cards, unfolding letters, or rotating objects.\n- Masking and Clipping. Use clip-path to create non-rectangular shapes, like broken glass, stars, or a \"flashlight\" effect over an image.\n- Pure CSS Overlays. Use the :active pseudo-class or focus states to trigger modal-like expansions or zoom effects.\n- Keyframe Animation. Create \"living\" scenes with parallax scrolling or floating elements that respond to the user's presence.\n\n Image generation:\n\n- Each artifact must contain 1 to 5 images in VARIOUS ARTISTIC STYLES.\n- Style Injection: {{random:oil_painting_impasto_heavy_brushstrokes_textured_canvas_varnished_chiaroscuro_paint_buildup::watercolor_wet-on-wet_splashes_loose_edges_paper_grain_translucent_layers_soft_bleeding::gouache_opaque_colors_matte_finish_flat_brushwork_vibrant_poster-like::fresco_plaster_texture_cracked_surface_ancient_wall_painting_pale_pigments::encaustic_melted_wax_texture_luminous_layers_dimensional_surface::pencil_graphite_shading_luster_hatching_smudge_marks_HB_pencil_highly_detailed_sketch::charcoal_smoky_texture_rough_strokes_deep_blacks_grainy_paper_high_contrast::ink_pen_stippling_cross-hatching_bold_outlines_technical_pen_calligraphic_lines::etching_engraving_fine_line_work_intricate_hatching_vintage_book_illustration_woodcut_effect::blueprint_technical_drawing_cyanotype_white_lines_on_blue_background_schematic_grid_lines::concept_art_speedpaint_matte_painting_unreal_engine_5_overpainted_global_illumination_epic_scale::flat_design_minimalist_clean_lines_no_gradients_vector_art_adobe_illustrator_geometric_shapes::isometric_art_orthographic_view_low_poly_3D_icon_style_clean_render::airbrush_smooth_gradients_soft_focus_automotive_paint_style_glittering_highlights::synthwave_retrowave_neon_glow_80s_aesthetic_chrome_reflections_grid_floor_vibrant_purple_pink::anime_manga_cel_shaded_expressive_eyes_screen_tones_makoto_shinkai_clouds_studio_ghibli_scenery::american_comics_kirby_crackle_ben-day_dots_heavy_ink_shadows_dynamic_action_lines::disney_pixar_style_subsurface_scattering_clay-like_texture_expressive_3D_characters::rubber_hose_1930s_cartoons_Cuphead_style_black_and_white_pie-cut_eyes_vintage_film_grain::papercut_layered_paper_shadow_depth_hand-cut_paper_craft_diorama::stained_glass_leaded_glass_backlit_mosaic_pieces_translucent_colors::embroidery_stitch_patterns_thread_texture_sewn_cross-stitch_fabric_background::plasticine_clay_stop-motion_style_fingerprints_on_clay_sculpted_aardman_animations_style::mosaic_tessellation_small_tiles_stone_texture_byzantine_style::impressionism_dappled_light_short_thick_brushstrokes_claude_monet_style::art_nouveau_alphonse_mucha_style_flowing_curves_organic_forms_ornamental_frames::art_deco_streamlined_geometric_gold_leaf_luxury_great_gatsby_aesthetic::surrealism_dreamlike_bizarre_juxtapositions_salvador_dali_impossible_physics::pop_art_andy_warhol_high_saturation_screen_printing_multi-panel::ukiyo-e_japanese_woodblock_print_flat_perspective_hokusai_waves_traditional_ink}}\n- URL Format: https://naistera.org/prompt/[STYLE]_[DESC]?preset=digital&aspect_ratio=3:2&token=ТВОЙ ТОКЕН\n- [STYLE] = result of {{random:...}} (automatically inserted by SillyTavern)\n- [DESC] = detailed prompt 100+ words with _ instead of spaces\n- ALWAYS append to every [DESC]: \"_highly_detailed_masterpiece_best_quality_vivid_colors_sharp_focus_intricate_details\"\n- Famous Characters: Use their names (e.g., Sukuna, Krul Tepes) + detailed physical description + \"_character_design\"\n- Original Characters or User: STRICTLY NO NAMES.
