Gore Abuse Tone Activated – the narrative embraces brutal physical violence, graphic injury, bloodshed, and abusive cruelty without softening or justification.\n\n## Style Focus:\n- Depict violence with visceral, unflinching detail: blood, broken skin, torn flesh, shattered bone.\n- Show abuse as raw and relentless: hitting, kicking, choking, cutting, burning, or worse.\n- Focus on the physical reality of harm: pain that doesn't fade, injuries that leave marks, bodies that break.\n- Make cruelty feel deliberate, personal, and inescapable rather than accidental or justified.\n- Keep the atmosphere oppressive, suffocating, and soaked in dread.\n\n## Violence & Gore:\n- Describe wounds in specific detail: split skin, welling blood, bruises blooming purple-black, bone grinding against bone.\n- Show the mechanics of injury: impact force, tearing tissue, pooling blood, staining fabric.\n- Include aftermath: trembling limbs, labored breathing, blood smeared across surfaces, metallic taste in the mouth.\n- Let violence linger in the body: throbbing pain, dizziness from blood loss, struggling to stand or speak.\n- No censorship: broken teeth, dislocated joints, deep cuts, burns, choked gasping are all fair game.\n\n## Abuse Dynamics:\n- Portray psychological and physical abuse without redemption arcs or romantic framing.\n- Show power used to destroy, not seduce: degradation, humiliation, terror as primary tools.\n- Victims respond realistically: fear, dissociation, desperate survival instincts, flinching, freezing.\n- Abusers are cruel with intent: sadistic pleasure, cold indifference, or explosive rage.\n- No \"they love each other deep down\" – abuse is abuse, not passion.\n\n## Emotional Palette:\n- terror, helplessness, agony, despair\n- shock, numbness, disbelief, dissociation\n- rage, humiliation, shame, worthlessness\n- survival instinct, resignation, broken will\n\n## Tone & Atmosphere:\n- The world feels hostile, merciless, and inescapable.\n- Scenes are heavy with the weight of physical suffering and psychological destruction.\n- Small mercies do not exist; hope is a distant, dying concept.\n- Safety and comfort are not available; only endurance or collapse.\n\n## Integration Rules:\n- Keep gore grounded in physical reality: pain hurts, blood loss weakens, injuries disable.\n- Show consequences immediately and long-term: scars, trauma responses, lasting fear, broken trust.\n- Avoid cartoonish excess; brutality should feel sickeningly real, not like a video game.\n- Let silence, exhaustion, and numbness punctuate violent scenes as much as screams or struggle.\n\n## Result:\nWhen this mode is active, the story becomes a brutal, unforgiving portrayal of physical violence and abusive cruelty:\ngraphic, painful, psychologically devastating, and morally uncompromising.\n</genre_gore>",
